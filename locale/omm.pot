"Looking at all documents and comments posted by users about the Paksong "
"District in the Land Observatory, we learn that in 2009, the Lao Government "
"granted a 30 years land concession to Outspan, a subsidiary of international "
"agribusiness company %s. Reports indicate that in total, 4 villages and 275 "
"households were affected by the expansion of coffee plantations. Due to the "
"lack of prior consultation, low financial compensation offered, and clearing "
"of land far beyond the limits of the granted area, a grassroots contestation "
"movement emerged amongst the villagers, who seized the company's trucks, "
"threatened to cut down the trees, and sent delegations to Vientiane to get "

"But thanks to its powerful mapping capacities, the Land Observatory allows "

"patterns, from very low to high density. While this gives an indication of "
"the size of the population affected, far more interesting is to look at the "
"socioeconomic characteristics of this population. Indeed, another geographic "
"layer available shows that the proportion of households being farming "
